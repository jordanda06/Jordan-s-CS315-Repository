# Jordan-s-CS315-Repository
This is for CS Colloquium
This is a pretty nice README.md file that's just sitting here waiting for instructions. I was asked to fill it with some content and I'm not too confident on what they want me to put so I'm gonna type this out and most likely wait, assuming that it'll be used for reports, which would be cool.
